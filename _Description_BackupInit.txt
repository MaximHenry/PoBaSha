This can be used like a portable backup script system !

If you want to use the current folder as base
you don't have to change anything !



Generate Directories for Backup and Log Files

If not exist %cd%\Log mkdir %cd%\Log

If not exist %cd%\Server mkdir %cd%\Server


Set Variable to use the current directory
of the script as base.

To Separate Script-Directory from Backup and Log directory
change for your needs. You may have to generate the Server 
and Log directories by yourself in your preferred path.

Again:	If you want to use the current folder as base
	you don't have to change anything.


Scriptpath as current directory

set scriptpath=%cd%

Logpath in Folder Log below current directory

set logpath=%scriptpath%\Log

Root Folder for the Backups in Folder Server 

set targetroot=%scriptpath%\Server

Rename template file - no wait for example server

ren S_Template.cmd NoExecute_S_Template.cmd

Calling the backup scripts with a Loop and
handing over the variables.
Prefix for scripts to be called is "S_" - S like Server ;-)
So you can prepare scripts without execution.

For %%n in (S_*.cmd) do call %%n %scriptpath% %logpath% %targetroot% %%n


Rename NoExecute.. file

ren NoExecute_S_Template.cmd S_Template.cmd


set scriptpath=

set logpath=

set targetroot=
